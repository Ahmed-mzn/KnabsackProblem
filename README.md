# Knabsack Problem

###Implementation of several algorithms for solving 1/0 knapsack problem on Python.

In the Knapsack problem, our goal is to find the optimal combination of objects which are bound by a total weight W and which achieve the heighest profit / value (v). The problem can be applied to various real life applications such resource allocation problems.


###Knapsack problem description
The Knapsack problem is simple. You have a Knapsack and N objects which each of them can be described with two properties, value (profit)P and weigh W. Using GA we are trying to fit in knapsack as many object as possible with a certain limit depending of the complexity of the problem. In this case we are going to experiment with limit C 26 and 5 objects. It is a maximization problem with Fitness function as much sum of profit as we can without exceeding the space limit C.
